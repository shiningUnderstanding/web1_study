	<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
	<p>A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web
		pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name
		and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are
		wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.</p>

	<p>All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the
		World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be
		accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website
		for its employees.</p>
